# littering-in-no-time
The accumulation of plastic waste in nature and public spaces, resulting from human behavior, has created both an ecological and an aesthetic problem. Volunteer clean-up efforts have been a important factor in addressing this issue. Clean-up efforts by volunteers have been a key component in tackling this problem but their efforts are overseen by policy makers because the time spend by these volunteers is not sufficiently researched. A time-cost analysis was conducted to identify the time spent on litter picking and to identify the differences between the different forms of litter and the different locations the litter was picked at. These insights helped in the development of more effective litter policy in the Netherlands by quantifying the time required to pick litter with a data driven approach. The results indicated that, on average, the volunteer walked approximately 1.2 kilometers slower than his normal pace when picking litter. There was also a significant difference in the time required between small and bigger pieces of litter. The study revealed that smaller pieces are typically picked more efficiently, while larger pieces require more time. There was no significant difference in the time required between the different pick locations. Local governments and policymakers can use this data to make data driven decisions on resource allocation and the prioritization of litter types. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of volunteer participation in cleaning the public environment by quantifying the time spent.

## Data
- GPX file containing: location and time
- Excel file containing: location, time and litter category of that pick

## Main Scripts
Scripts for running a basic forward in time simulation, can be done by running the following scripts:

- **src/01_read_data.py** : transforms, filters and harmonizes the data
- **src/02_exploratory_data_analysis_picks.ipynb** : finds paterns in pick data
- **src/03_exploratory_data_analysis_trajectory.ipynb**: finds paterns in GPS data
- **src/04_results**: containing all final analysis and graphs
